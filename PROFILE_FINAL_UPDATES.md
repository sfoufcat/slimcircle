# Profile System - Final Updates

## Issues Fixed (Nov 25, 2025 - Round 2)

### 1. ✅ Desktop Layout - Full Width Like Home/Squad
**Problem:** Profile was too narrow on desktop, looked like a mobile tab view centered on screen.

**Solution:** Updated to match Home and Squad page layouts:
- Changed from `max-w-4xl` to `max-w-[1400px]` (same as Home/Squad)
- Changed padding from `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8` to `px-4 sm:px-8 lg:px-16` (same as Home/Squad)
- Added `pt-4` and `pb-32` for consistent vertical spacing
- Removed individual component padding since parent now handles it

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/profile/page.tsx` - Main container
- `src/components/profile/ProfileHeader.tsx` - Removed px padding
- `src/components/profile/ProfileTabs.tsx` - Removed px padding  
- `src/components/profile/MyJourneyTab.tsx` - Removed px padding
- `src/components/profile/MyDetailsTab.tsx` - Removed px padding

**Result:** Profile now uses full width on desktop like Home and Squad pages, with proper responsive spacing.

### 2. ✅ Clerk Profile Picture Upload Integration
**Problem:** Pencil button showed an alert instead of actually letting users change their profile picture.

**Solution:** Integrated Clerk's native `openUserProfile()` function:
- Imported `useClerk` hook from `@clerk/nextjs`
- Used `openUserProfile()` function which opens Clerk's user profile modal
- When clicked, users can immediately edit their profile picture in Clerk's native UI
- Changes sync automatically and appear in the profile

**Code Change:**
```typescript
import { useClerk } from '@clerk/nextjs';

const { openUserProfile } = useClerk();

// In the pencil button onClick:
onClick={() => {
  openUserProfile();
}}
```

**Result:** Clicking the pencil icon now natively opens Clerk's profile editor where users can change their picture.

## Layout Comparison

### Before:
```css
max-w-2xl (672px) → Too narrow on desktop
px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 → Inconsistent with other pages
```

### After:
```css
max-w-[1400px] → Same as Home/Squad
px-4 sm:px-8 lg:px-16 → Same as Home/Squad
pt-4 pb-32 → Consistent vertical spacing
```

---

## Desktop Layout Details

Profile page now matches Home and Squad:

**Container:**
```tsx
<div className="max-w-[1400px] mx-auto px-4 sm:px-8 lg:px-16 pb-32 pt-4">
```

**Responsive Breakpoints:**
- Mobile (< 640px): 16px side padding
- Tablet (640px - 1024px): 32px side padding
- Desktop (1024px+): 64px side padding
- Max content width: 1400px, centered

**Visual Effect:**
- Content breathes on large screens
- Proper use of available space
- Consistent with rest of the app
- No more "mobile centered" look on desktop
