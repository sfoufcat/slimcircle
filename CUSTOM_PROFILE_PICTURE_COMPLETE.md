```

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Avatar Section (Edit Mode):

```
   ┌─────────────────┐
   │                 │
   │   [  Avatar  ]  │  ← Shows preview if selected
   │      Image      │
   │                 │
   │          ✏️     │  ← Click to upload
   └─────────────────┘
```

### States:

1. **Default**: Shows current avatar (Clerk or Firebase)
2. **Hovering Pencil**: Button highlights
3. **Selecting**: File picker opens
4. **Preview**: Selected image shows immediately
5. **Uploading**: Pencil shows spinner
