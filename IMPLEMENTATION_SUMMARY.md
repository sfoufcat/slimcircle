## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Goal Input Experience
- **Typewriter Effect**: Cycling through example goals
  - "launch the GrowthAddicts app..."
  - "grow to $50k MRR..."
  - "lose 10 kg..."
  - And more
- **Prefix**: "I want to..." automatically shown
- **Date Picker**: Integrated date selector for target dates
- **Character Limit**: 200 characters max
- **Auto-focus**: Input field focused on page load

### 2. AI Validation
- **Smart Validation**: Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet to analyze goals
- **Criteria Checked**:
  - Specific and measurable
  - Focused on single objective
  - Realistic for timeframe
  - Clear and actionable
- **Two Outcomes**:
  - `status: "good"` → Proceed directly
  - `status: "needs_improvement"` → Show suggestions

### 3. Suggestion Modal
- Shows original goal with target date
- Displays AI feedback explaining the issue
- Suggests improved version
- Two action buttons:
  - "Edit my goal" → Pre-fills suggested goal
  - "Proceed with this goal" → Keeps original

### 4. Commitment Screen
- Congratulatory message
- Success icon with checkmark
- "Let's go!" call-to-action
- Completes onboarding flow

## 💾 Database Schema

Goals stored in Firebase `users` collection:

```typescript
{
  goal: string;                    // "Launch the app"
  goalTargetDate: string;          // "2026-05-31"
  goalSetAt: string;               // ISO timestamp
  goalIsAISuggested: boolean;      // true/false
  goalHistory: [{
    goal: string;
    targetDate: string;
    setAt: string;
    completedAt: string | null;
  }]
}
```
