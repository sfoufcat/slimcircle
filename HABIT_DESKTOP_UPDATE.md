- `src/app/api/habits/route.ts` - Detailed server-side logging

**What's Logged:**
- User authentication status
- Request body contents
- Validation results
- Firebase operations
- Detailed error messages with stack traces

## Debugging the "Failed to create habit" Error

### Step 1: Check Browser Console
When you try to create a habit, open the browser console (F12) and look for:
1. `Submitting habit data:` - Shows what data is being sent
2. Any error messages from the client-side
3. Network tab - Check the `/api/habits` POST request status and response

### Step 2: Check Server Terminal
Look at your dev server terminal for logs like:
```
[Habits API] POST - User ID: user_xxxxx
[Habits API] POST - Request body: {...}
[Habits API] POST - Creating habit: {...}
[Habits API] POST - Habit created with ID: xxxxx
```

Or error messages like:
```
[Habits API] POST - Error creating habit: [error details]
```

### Step 3: Verify Firebase Connection

Check if Firebase Admin SDK is properly initialized by looking for these environment variables:
```bash
# Run this in your terminal (with doppler)
doppler run -- env | grep FIREBASE
```

You should see:
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`
- `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`

### Step 4: Test API Directly

You can test the API endpoint directly using curl:
```bash
# Get your auth token from the browser (open DevTools > Application > Cookies > __session)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/habits \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: __session=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE" \
  -d '{
    "text": "Test habit",
    "linkedRoutine": "after breakfast",
    "frequencyType": "daily",
    "frequencyValue": 7,
    "reminder": null,
    "targetRepetitions": null
  }'
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Unauthorized (401)
**Cause:** Clerk authentication not working
**Solution:** 
- Check if you're logged in
- Verify Clerk keys in environment variables
- Check browser cookies

### Issue 2: Missing Required Fields (400)
**Cause:** Form data not being sent correctly
**Solution:**
- Check console for "Submitting habit data" log
- Verify all required fields (text, frequencyType) have values

### Issue 3: Internal Server Error (500)
**Cause:** Firebase Admin SDK or database issue
**Solution:**
- Check server logs for detailed error
- Verify Firebase credentials are set
- Check if Firebase project exists and is accessible

### Issue 4: CORS or Network Error
**Cause:** Network configuration
**Solution:**
- Verify dev server is running
- Check if using correct URL (http://localhost:3000)
- Try clearing browser cache

## Firebase Setup Checklist

✅ Firestore rules are correct (server-side only access)
✅ Admin SDK initialization code is in place
✅ API routes are using `adminDb.collection('habits')`

Still need to verify:
- [ ] Environment variables are set correctly
- [ ] Firebase project is active
- [ ] Service account has proper permissions

## Testing the Desktop Layout

1. Navigate to `/habits/new`
2. The form should now:
   - Take up more width on desktop (up to 900px)
   - Have proper spacing and padding
   - Not be constrained to mobile frame
   - Have white background card with rounded corners
   - Have proper button styling

3. Try creating a habit with:
   - Text: "Test habit"
   - Linked routine: "after breakfast"
   - Frequency: "Every day" (default)
   - No reminder
   - No target

4. Watch the console for logs and see if it successfully creates

## Next Steps

1. Try creating a habit and check the console/terminal logs
2. Share the exact error message you see
3. If it's a Firebase auth issue, we'll need to verify the credentials
4. If it's a different issue, the logs will tell us exactly what's wrong

## Files to Check if Still Having Issues

1. `.env.local` or Doppler secrets - Firebase credentials
2. Server terminal - Error logs
3. Browser console - Client-side errors
4. Network tab - API response details
