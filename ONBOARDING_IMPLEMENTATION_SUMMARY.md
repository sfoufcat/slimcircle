# Onboarding Flow Implementation - Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The first part of the onboarding flow for Growth Addicts has been successfully implemented.

## 🎯 What Was Built

### New Pages Created

1. **`/onboarding/welcome`** - Welcome to GrowthAddicts screen
   - Based on Figma design (node-id=694-3035)
   - Features welcome message with gradient heading
   - Shows checklist of onboarding steps
   - "Let's Crush It!" CTA button

2. **`/onboarding/create-profile-intro`** - Create Your Public Profile intro screen
   - Based on Figma design (node-id=409-3877)
   - Explains profile importance
   - Two CTAs: "Next" or "I'll do it later in settings"

### Updated Files

1. **Type Definitions** (`src/types/index.ts`)
   - Added `OnboardingStatus` type
   - Added `onboardingStatus` and `hasCompletedOnboarding` fields to `FirebaseUser`

2. **Profile Edit Form** (`src/components/profile/ProfileEditForm.tsx`)
   - Added `fromOnboarding` prop for onboarding mode
   - Special save behavior when in onboarding mode

3. **Profile Page** (`src/app/profile/page.tsx`)
   - Handles `fromOnboarding` query parameter
   - Routes to mission page after save in onboarding mode
   - Routes back to create-profile-intro on cancel in onboarding mode

4. **User API** (`src/app/api/user/me/route.ts`)
   - Allows updating `onboardingStatus` and `hasCompletedOnboarding` fields

5. **Home Dashboard** (`src/app/page.tsx`)
   - Detects new users and incomplete onboarding
   - Redirects to appropriate onboarding step
   - Completed users skip onboarding

6. **Commitment Page** (`src/app/onboarding/commitment/page.tsx`)
   - Marks onboarding as completed
   - Sets `hasCompletedOnboarding` to true

7. **Clerk Sync** (`src/lib/clerk-firebase-sync.ts`)
   - Sets initial onboarding status for new users
   - New users start with `onboardingStatus: 'welcome'`

## 🔄 Complete Flow

```
Sign Up (Clerk Auth)
  ↓
/onboarding/welcome
  ↓ "Let's Crush It!"
/onboarding/create-profile-intro
  ↓ "Next" (or skip)
/profile?edit=true&fromOnboarding=true
  ↓ Save (onboarding mode)
/onboarding (Mission)
  ↓
/onboarding/goal
  ↓
/onboarding/commitment
  ↓ "Let's go!"
/ (Home Dashboard)
```

## 🎨 Design Implementation

Both new pages faithfully follow the Figma designs:

- **Typography**: `font-albert` for headings (36px), `font-sans` for body (18px)
- **Colors**: Yellow accent (`#f7c948`) for primary CTAs, dark (`#2c2520`) for secondary
- **Spacing**: Matches Figma with proper padding, gaps, and responsive layouts
- **Buttons**: Full-width rounded buttons with proper shadows and transitions

## 🔒 Onboarding Status Tracking

The system tracks onboarding progress through these states:

- `'welcome'` - At welcome screen
- `'create_profile_intro'` - At profile intro screen
- `'edit_profile'` - Editing profile
- `'mission'` - Setting mission/identity
- `'goal'` - Setting goal
- `'completed'` - Onboarding finished

## ✨ Key Features

1. **Resume Capability**: Users who exit mid-onboarding can resume where they left off
2. **Skip Profile**: Users can skip profile creation and do it later
3. **Smart Routing**: Automatic detection and redirect for incomplete onboarding
4. **Onboarding vs Normal**: Profile editing behaves differently during onboarding
5. **One-Time Flow**: Completed users never see onboarding again

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

2. You should automatically be redirected to `/onboarding/welcome`
3. Progress through each step and verify:
   - Navigation works correctly
   - Onboarding status updates
   - Profile edit in onboarding mode routes to mission
   - After commitment, you land on home dashboard
