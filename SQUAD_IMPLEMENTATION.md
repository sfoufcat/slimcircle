# Squad Feature Implementation

## Overview

The Squad feature allows users to join groups for accountability and mutual support. Squad members can see each other's progress, maintain a squad streak, and track collective alignment scores.

## Status: ✅ Implemented (with mock data)

All UI components are complete and functional with placeholder data. API routes and real calculations are marked with TODOs for Phase 2.

## Architecture

### Data Model

#### User Roles
- `user` - Regular user
- `coach` - Can create squads, assign users, edit squad metadata
- `super_admin` - Full admin rights

#### Collections

**squads**
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  name: string;
  avatarUrl: string;
  isPremium: boolean;
  coachId: string | null;
  streak: number | null;  // TODO: Real calculation
  avgAlignment: number | null;  // TODO: Real calculation
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

**squad_members**
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  squadId: string;
  userId: string;
  roleInSquad: 'member' | 'coach';
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  imageUrl: string;
  alignmentScore: number | null;  // TODO: Real calculation
  streak: number | null;  // TODO: Real calculation
  moodState: 'energized' | 'confident' | 'neutral' | 'uncertain' | 'stuck' | null;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

## TODO: Phase 2 - Real Calculations

### 1. Alignment Score
Calculate based on:

- Individual: consecutive days with completed daily focus tasks
- Squad: consecutive days where >50% of members completed tasks

### 3. Mood State
Map alignment score to mood:
- 90-100: energized
- 70-89: confident
- 50-69: neutral
- 30-49: uncertain
- 0-29: stuck

### 4. Contribution Grid
- Query last 30-60 days
- For each day, calculate % of squad members who completed tasks
- Map to color scale

### 5. Top Percentile
- Query all squads
- Rank by average alignment
- Calculate percentile

## Firestore Security Rules

Added rules for squads and squad_members collections:

- **squads**: Read by all authenticated, create/update by coach/super_admin, delete by super_admin
- **squad_members**: Read by squad members, create/delete by coach/super_admin

See `FIRESTORE_SCHEMAS.md` for details.

---

## Design System

All components follow the existing Growth Addicts design system:

- **Font**: Albert Sans (headings), Geist (body)
- **Colors**: 
  - Primary text: #1a1a1a
  - Secondary text: #5f5a55
  - Muted text: #a7a39e
  - Background: #faf8f6
  - Elevated: #f3f1ef
  - Accent: #a07855 (brown)
  - Border: #e1ddd8
- **Spacing**: Matches existing patterns
- **Rounded corners**: 20px (cards), 32px-40px (buttons/containers)

---

## Testing

To test different states:

1. **Empty State**: In `useSquad.ts`, uncomment:
   ```typescript
   setSquad(null);
   setMembers([]);
   setStats(null);
   ```

2. **Premium Squad**: In mock data, set:
   ```typescript
   isPremium: true,
   coachId: 'coach_123'
   ```
   And add coach member with `roleInSquad: 'coach'`

3. **Different Mood States**: Modify `moodState` values in mock members

---

## Navigation

Squad page is accessible via:
- Bottom nav (mobile)
- Sidebar (desktop)
- Path: `/squad`

---

## Next Steps

1. Create API routes for CRUD operations
2. Implement real alignment score calculation
3. Implement real streak calculation
4. Implement contribution grid data fetching
5. Add invite friend flow
6. Add upgrade to premium flow
7. Add coach assignment UI (super admin)
8. Add squad creation UI (coach/super admin)
9. Test with real Firebase data
