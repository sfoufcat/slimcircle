## 🗄️ Data Model

```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;                     // Auto-generated doc ID
  userId: string;                 // Owner's Clerk ID
  title: string;                  // Task description
  status: 'pending' | 'completed';
  listType: 'focus' | 'backlog';  // Focus (max 3) or Backlog
  order: number;                  // Order within the list
  date: string;                   // ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  isPrivate: boolean;             // Keep task private
  createdAt: string;              // ISO timestamp
  updatedAt: string;              // ISO timestamp
  completedAt?: string;           // ISO timestamp (when marked complete)
}
```

### Business Rules

1. **Daily Focus List:**
   - Maximum of 3 tasks per day in "focus"
   - If user tries to add a 4th, it goes to "backlog" automatically
   - Tasks can be reordered via drag-and-drop

2. **Backlog:**
   - Unlimited tasks
   - Can be hidden/shown with toggle button
   - Users can promote tasks from backlog to focus (if focus has < 3)

3. **Per-Day:**
   - Tasks are scoped to a specific date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Each day has its own set of focus + backlog tasks

## 🔐 Security

### Firestore Rules

```javascript
// Tasks collection (Daily Focus)
match /tasks/{taskId} {
  // Users can read their own tasks (private or public)
  allow read: if isAuthenticated() && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
  
  // Users can create their own tasks
  allow create: if isAuthenticated() && 
    request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
  
  // Users can update their own tasks
  allow update: if isOwner(resource.data.userId);
  
  // Users can delete their own tasks
  allow delete: if isOwner(resource.data.userId);
}
```

## 🐛 Known Issues / TODOs

None at this time. All core functionality is implemented and tested.

## 📝 Usage Example

```typescript
import { DailyFocusSection } from '@/components/tasks/DailyFocusSection';

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Other homepage content */}
      
      <DailyFocusSection />
      
      {/* Habits section, etc. */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

The component handles all state, API calls, and UI interactions internally.
